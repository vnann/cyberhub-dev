  The scope of this policy applies to all employees, including part-time and contract employees who wish to use their own devices to access the company’s network, applications, and services.

## Mobile Devices and Support

- The IT department will support BYOD devices for configuration and troubleshooting of network connectivity to company resources. Any hardware and operating system issues must be directed to the device manufacturer.
- The IT department will install a mobile application management (MAM) tool on all BYOD devices. The MAM tool will allow IT to control and secure the company-specific applications, while everything else on the phone is untouched (Madden, 2012).
- The company supports devices that run Google Android 9.0 and later, and Apple iOS 12.4 and later.

## Security

## Reimbursement

Employees are solely responsible for the cost of their mobile devices. The company is not responsible for any expenses incurred from the use of any mobile devices including service plans, fees, and taxes. The employee is free to choose any mobile device as long as the company supports the device.

## Alternative Mobile Device Option

If the employee does not want to use their mobile device, they can opt for a company- provided device. An employee has the option to choose a mobile device from a provided list. The employee pays the cost of the mobile device and the company pays the monthly service plan. The mobile device comes with mobile device management (MDM) software pre-installed to support remote management of the device, such as installing company-approved apps. It also provides the capability of a remote wipe of the device in case the device is lost or stolen. No personal apps or data is allowed.
